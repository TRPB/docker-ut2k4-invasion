Server Admin READ ME RIGHT NOW IMPORTANT INFORMATION!!!!!! :)

If you want players running old versions to connect to your server, before installing the new version, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt in your UT2004/System directory.
2. Type:
(Windows) ucc mastermd5 -a UT2004RPG.u 
(Linux) ./ucc-bin mastermd5 -a UT2004RPG.u 
3. Now upgrade, replacing UT2004RPG.u with the 1.1 version. Repeat #2.

If you've already upgraded or you're installing it for the first time and need the old versions of UT2004RPG.u, you may download them from:
http://mysterial.linuxgangster.org/files/UT2004RPGOldVersions.zip
Just follow the steps above for each version of UT2004RPG.u in the archive. Make sure to reinstall the latest version when you're done!
